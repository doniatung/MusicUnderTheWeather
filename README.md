# MusicUnderTheWeather

Outline: 
Okay, so this is a website that gives you music suggestions depending on the weather of your location. With the use of the Weather Underground API, we can find the weather of a user's location if they enter their city. The result of their search (with the input being the city) is a carefully curated list of songs for that given weather range (<30, 30-50, 50-70, 70-90, 90+ all in Farenhiet), and the user can choose to play the songs on the frames embedded in the site page. 


How to Run: 
- Enter your virtual environment 
- "python app.py" and then copy/paste http://127.0.0.1:5000/ into your given browser
- Create an account and login
- Enter your city (or any other city if you really want to)
